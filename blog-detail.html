            A group of Activision Blizzard workers officially announced a strike
            fund Thursday morning following two days of walkouts in support of
            quality assurance
          </h4>
          <p class="body-3">
            The group, called ABK Workers’ Alliance, came together in July after
            California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) filed
            a lawsuit preceded by a two-year investigation into the company’s
            alleged “frat boy culture.” Activision Blizzard workers are not
            officially unionized, which means that the strike, initiated
            Thursday, will not have union protections. The group is being
            assisted by the Communication Workers of America, the Washington
            Post reported. Employees began signing union cards Thursday in an
            effort to get the group recognized, according to the report. It’s
            unclear how many workers are participating in the strike, which has
            been ongoing since Monday. More than 1,700 contracted workers and
            employees signed a petition in November demanding that CEO Bobby
            Kotick resign.

              Where they are raising money for a strike fund, ABK Workers’
              Alliance leaders said Activision Blizzard leadership has only
              continued to ignore demands
            </h4>
            <p class="body-3">
              Some QA workers at Activision Blizzard and its subsidiaries have
              walked out of work each day since Monday, in protest of layoffs
              last week. (Activision Blizzard doesn’t characterize these job
              losses as layoffs, however: The company said that these people
              were temporary contract workers, not employees, and that it was
              not renewing their contracts.) Activision Blizzard is in the
              process of converting 500 temporary jobs to full-time status, the
              company said — though the group of Raven Software QA workers were
              not part of that initiative.
